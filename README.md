What is Prog-2000
---
Red River College seems to be far behind in terms of how technology is used in a classroom enviroment. So I've created this github page for "Intro to Micro and C Programming" in hopes of not only teaching my self how to use github while learning C, but also to prevent unfair advantage over year 1 students who don't know anyone in year 2 that could give them old course material. 


You can find the <a href="https://github.com/glennlopez/Prog-2000/wiki">Answers to Package Questions</a> here. Exam questions will be provided as soon as I get access to one (No logical reason exists as to why students should not have access to previous exams online to use as a practice exams... unless they re-use the same exam question out of lazyness).
